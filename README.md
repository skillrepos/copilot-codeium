## Step 3. Provide the token to authorize Codeium use in the Codespace.

Switch back to your codespace. Use F1 to bring up the Command Palette. (Ignore any messages about *signin failed*.) In the Command Palette, search for Codeium: Provide Authentication Token. 

![Providing the token...](./images/codeium-09.png?raw=true "Providing the token...")

After you find that, hit *Enter* and then paste in the token.

This will open it up in a tab above your terminal. Then you can follow along with the steps in the labs. 
Any command in the gray boxes is either code intended to be run in the console or code to be updated in a file.
