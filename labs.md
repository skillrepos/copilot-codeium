## Revision 2.0 - 06/19/24

**Follow the startup instructions in the README.md file IF NOT ALREADY DONE!**

**NOTE: To copy and paste in the codespace, you may need to use keyboard commands - CTRL-C and CTRL-V.**

**Lab 1 - Learning how to create good prompts for Codeium**

**Purpose: In this lab, we’ll start to learn about Codeium and how it generates code based on the prompts we provide**

1. Create a new file. In the terminal, enter

   ```
   code index.js
   ```

2. Afterwards this file should be open in a tab in the editor.

3. Let's see how Codeium responds to a generic request. Go to that tab and type in a comment that says

```
// function to parse data
```
4. Hit return and notice the code that Codeium suggested. This is likely more generic than we want, but hit tab to select that line.
   
5. After hitting tab, Codeium will generate another part of the function. (If not, you may need to hit return.) Hit tab to accept it. Continue until you get a complete function. One example of what code may look like is below.

![Codeium generated function](./images/codeium-15.png?raw=true "Codeium generated function")
   
6. This prompt is not specific enough for Codeium to interpret what we want to do.  Highlight the code and delete it, so we can try again.

7. Now type a comment at the top that says

```
// function to parse url
```
8. Hit enter and you will probably see a similar line to

```
function parseURL(url) {
```

9. Just hit Tab to accept it and Enter again. Continue to use Tab and Enter to build out the function from the suggestions that Codeium provides until you get a complete function definition - something like shown below.

![Codeium generated function](./images/codeium-16.png?raw=true "Codeium generated function")    

10. Let's do one more pass at getting a specific prompt for Copilot. Delete all the code currently in index.js. This time we will not enter a comment, but will enter a specific funtion name.
Type the following in the empty file. (There are no parentheses after the *splitURLandReturnComponents* text.)  Do not hit tab or return yet.

```
function splitURLandReturnComponents
```

11.  With this function name, Copilot should suggest a full function definition - in fact it may suggest several.  To see the options, hover over the first line and a small window should appear. This window will note how many options there are and provide "<" and ">" links to toggle between them.  Click on the "<" and ">" buttons to see the differences in the available suggestions. Some may be full function suggestions and others may be only partial suggestions.  Choose an alternative you like and then select Tab to accept it.

**Lab 2 - Using Codeium to refactor existing code**

**Purpose: In this lab, we'll explore options for refactoring with Codeium**

1. Create a new file named prime.py. Create it via the same process as we used in Lab 1 by entering the line below in the terminal.

```
code prime.py
```

2. Start typing a function definition as below and enter to get to a suggestion from Codeium.
```
def is_prime(n):
```
3. Pick one of the offered suggestions and hit Tab. Continue until you get a full function definition. One example is shown below.

![alternative suggestions inline](./images/codeium-18.png?raw=true "alternative suggestions inline")   

4. Let's next try some of the refactor options provided by Codeium. Click on the *Refactor* link in the Codelens menu above the code. Then select the option to *Make this faster and more efficient* (You can click on the entry in the list or type in the selection in the text entry area.)

![codelens refactor](./images/codeium-91.png?raw=true "codelens refactor")   
![refactor for efficiency](./images/codeium-25.png?raw=true "refactor for efficiency")         

5. Codeium will then generate any suggested changes inline. Give it a moment to complete and then click on *Accept* to accept the changes.

![refactor to add comments](./images/codeium-32.png?raw=true "refactor to add comments") 

6. Next, click on the *Refactor* link and select the option to *Clean up this code*.

![refactor to clean up code](./images/codeium-22.png?raw=true "refactor to clean up code") 
  
7. Give Codeium a moment to generate is suggested changes. This time after reviewing, we'll reject the changes. Click on the *Reject* option.

![refactor to clean up code](./images/codeium-33.png?raw=true "refactor to clean up code")     

8. Finally, let's add some print statements for debugging. Select the *Refactor* link again and this time, start typing "Add print" in the text box to filter the choices. You can then select the full option from the filtered list.

![refactor to add print statements](./images/codeium-34.png?raw=true "refactor to add print statements")  

9. After a moment, Codeium will suggest a set of changes for adding the print statements. You can just go ahead and accept these.

![refactor to add print statements](./images/codeium-35.png?raw=true "refactor to add print statements")

**Lab 3 - Using Codeium to explain and document code**

**Purpose: In this lab, we’ll see a few other ways to leverage Codeium after the initial coding is done**

1. Let's have Codeium explain how our current function works. In the Codelens menu above the code, click on the *Explain* link. 

![explain link](./images/codeium-36.png?raw=true "explain link") 

2. The explanation is provided in the Codeium chat window. Notice the context that Codeium used (section *A* in the screenshot) and the full explanation (section *B* in the screenshot).

![explain link](./images/codeium-37.png?raw=true "explain link") 

3. Suppose we want to save this chat for future reference or to easily share.. Click on the 3 vertical dots in the upper right of the *CHAT* tab.

![chat menu](./images/codeium-38.png?raw=true "chat menu") 

4. Next, click on the *Export Conversation* item and download the file as a .md (*markdown*) text file.

![download markdown file](./images/codeium-39.png?raw=true "download markdown file") 

5. From wherever you downloaded it to, you can open up the .md file and view it.

![view chat file](./images/codeium-40.png?raw=true "view chat file")    

6. We can also use shortcut commands to do these same kind of tasks. In the Codeium Chat interface, enter the text below to see the results. Notice the results may be more in a numbered list order than the free-form text previously used.
```
/explain is_prime
```
![explain in chat](./images/codeium-41.png?raw=true "explain in chat") 

7. We are done with the explanations, so let's clear those Chats from the history. Click on the *Conversations* icon (the one that looks like a clockface with a circular arrow) and select that.

![conversations icon](./images/codeium-42.png?raw=true "conversations icon")    

8. From this screen, you'll see a list of any previous chats. Hover over any chats that you want to delete, and click on the trash can icon to delete the chat. Then, when done, click on the *Back to chat* link to return back to the main chat interface.

![conversations icon](./images/codeium-43.png?raw=true "conversations icon")    

9. Next, let's generate some doc for this code. Click on the *Generate Docstring* link in the Codelens section.

![generate docstring](./images/codeium-44.png?raw=true "generate docstring")    

10. The proposed change will show up in the chat interface. When it is ready, you can click on the *Apply Diff* link and then *Accept* the change in the editor.

![apply docstring](./images/codeium-45.png?raw=true "apply docstring")  

11. Finally, let's have Codeium add some more comments in our code. Click on the *Refactor* link again and this time, select the last item *Verbosely comment this code so that I can understand what's going on. When Codeium finishes the suggestions, you can just *Accept* them. (If there is some part of the proposed change that you don't like, you can just delete those lines.)

![add comments](./images/codeium-46.png?raw=true "add comments")

**Lab 4 - Using Codeium to generate tests**

**Purpose: In this lab, we'll see some examples of having Codeium automatically generate testscases for our code**

1. Start out in the *prime.py* file we've been using. Bring up the inline chat interface with *CMD+I* and enter the following directive. Then click on the *Codeium: Submit* button.

```
# create a function to do 5 unit tests of the code
```
![generating tests via comment](./images/codeium-47.png?raw=true "generating tests via comment") 

2. This gives us a set of unit tests, but let's see what other ways we can generate testing code. Go ahead and *Reject* the suggestion.

![suggested tests via comment](./images/codeium-48.png?raw=true "suggested tests via comment") 

3. Bring up the inline chat interface with *CMD+I* and enter the following directive. Then click on the *Codeium: Submit* button.

```
# /test
```
![generating tests via command](./images/codeium-49.png?raw=true "generating tests via command") 

4. Similar to the last option, this gives us a set of unit tests, but we may still be able to do better. Go ahead and *Reject* the suggestion.

![suggested tests via command](./images/codeium-50.png?raw=true "suggested tests via command") 

5. Let's try a slightly different way of generating tests.  Switch to the Chat interface and enter the following text. When you get the *"@prim"* part typed, Codeium should give you a popup to select the *is_prime()* function as shown in the screenshot below. Choose that and then hit return to issue the query to Codeium.
```
 How would you design a comprehensive test suite for the code in @prim
```
![suggested tests via chat](./images/codeium-51.png?raw=true "suggested tests via chat") 

6. After a few moments, Codeium should propose a set of steps for the test suite in the Chat interface, along with example code afterwards.

![suggested tests via chat](./images/codeium-52.png?raw=true "suggested tests via chat") 

7. Let's take the output of the chat and add it as a new file for the tests. Create a new file and call it *prime-tests.py*. You can do this from the codespace's terminal by typing the following:
```
code prime-tests.py
```
8. Switch to the new file if its not already open. Now, at the start of the code listing in the Chat interface, select the *Insert* tab and insert the code into the new *prime-tests.py* file.

![copied_tests via chat](./images/codeium-53.png?raw=true "copied tests via chat") 
  
9. Let's double-check with Codeium for any missing test cases. With the *prime-tests.py* file open, go to the Chat interface and enter the following:
```
identify any missing test cases

```
10. After this runs for a bit, you will likely see it generating test cases for a few more areas. When its done generating them, you can select the ones you want from the suggested code and paste into your file.

![copied_tests via chat](./images/codeium-54.png?raw=true "copied tests via chat") 
    
11. Save the new files if desired.

**Lab 5 - Using Codeium to help with SQL**

**Purpose: In this lab, we’ll see some examples of how to have Codeium help with writing SQL and also see how to add additional context**

1. Create a new file named dev.sql. You can create it via entering the line below in the terminal.

```
code dev.sql
```
   
2. Afterwards this file should be open in a tab in the editor. Assume we want to work with a database or database definition that defines a dataset for students, staff, curriculums, courses, schools of study, locations, and registrations for a university system. Let's see what Copilot would generate without any other context for a query to get all students in a course. Enter the following comment below and press Tab to accept suggestions. 

```
-- define a select statement to get all students enrolled in a course
```
![generated query](./images/codeium-55.png?raw=true "generated query") 
    

3. Go ahead and save this file as part of the project.  You can do this from the "3-line" menu under *File->Save*, or just
click on the *X* next to the file's name in it's tab and select to *Save* it.

![Save sql file](./images/codeium-56.png?raw=true "Save sql file") 

4. If the file is no longer open in the tabs, you can select the "Explorer" icon at the top of the sidebar and select the file in the list to open it back up.

![Reopening the file](./images/codeium-57.png?raw=true "Reopening the file") 
   
5. Let's see if we get any different results if we provide Copilot additional context. Open the file create-tables.sql in the editor from the GitHub repository. (You can either select and open it from the file list or use the command below from the terminal.) Scroll through it and take a quick look at the contents.

```
code create-tables.sql
```

6. Now with that file open, go back up to the top of the dev.sql file.  Highlight and delete the comment and resulting query from step 2.
  
7. Enter the same comment as before to request the query. (Basically, repeat step 2.) See what Copilot suggests this time. You can accept the suggestions or cycle through options. 

```
-- define a select statement to get all students enrolled in a course
```

8. If all goes well, this second pass should generate multiple completion options with many more specific references to the names and identifiers used in *create-tables.sql*. (You may want to cycle through the suggested options to get to the later ones - i.e. 8/8 for example.) Take a look at the query and then compare the names/identifiers used to the ones in the *create-tables.sql* file. This will show that Codeium picks up on context from other files available to it to make better suggestions.

![New query](./images/codeium-58.png?raw=true "New query") 

   
9. In some cases, we might be able to use a separate index to speed up operations.  Let's ask Copilot to create a new index based on the last query. Add the following line after the current query in the file *dev.sql*.

```
-- write an index to improve the performance of the query
```
![index](./images/codeium-59.png?raw=true "index") 

10. Let's suppose we also want to have a table to capture student attendance. We can ask Copilot to create the table definition for us.

```
-- define a table for student attendance to capture attendance by class
```

![status values](./images/codeium-60.png?raw=true "status values") 

11. Codeium can also create stored procedures. Let's ask it to create a new stored procedure for getting a list of enrolled students at a particular location. Let's use the **CMD+I** shortcut. Go to the bottom of the *dev.sql* file, invoke Codeium Chat via the shortcut and then enter the line below in the dialog and then click the *Submit* button. You can choose to **Accept** or **Discard** the result.

```
define a stored procedure to get course enrollment by location
```
![prompt for stored procedure](./images/codeium-61.png?raw=true "prompt for stored procedure") 
![results for stored procedure](./images/codeium-62.png?raw=true "results for stored procedure") 
  
12. Finally, let's see Codeium optimize a query for us. Suppose we want to get all the course registrations for September, 2023.  Enter the following query in the file.

```
select * from courses.registration where year(registration_date) = 2023 and month(registration_date) = 9
```

13. Ask Copilot to optimize the previous query. You can do this via highlighting the query, using the **CMD+I** shortcut and entering "/optimize" in the dialog. 
```
/optimize
```
![Optimizing a query](./images/codeium-63.png?raw=true "Optimizing a query") 

14. Afterwards, Codeium should generate a suggested optimization. You can *Accept* or *Reject* the result.
 
![Optimization suggestion](./images/codeium-64.png?raw=true "Optimization suggestion") 
    
<p align="center">
**[END OF LAB]**
</p>

**Lab 6 - Teaching Copilot about updates**

**Purpose: In this lab, we’ll see an example of what to do when Copilot does not have the most up-to-date information**

1. Create a new file called *explore.go* via the same approach as you used to create other files.

2. This file should now be open in an editor tab. Let's say we want to seed a random number generator with Go. Let's ask Codeium to write a function to do that. Prompt it through the **CMD+I** interface using the statement below. Then you can accept the suggested code.

```
write a function to seed a random number generator
```
![Asking Copilot to write function to seed a random number generator](./images/codeium-65.png?raw=true "Asking Copilot to write function to seed a random number generator") 

3. Codeium has probably generated code using the rand.Seed function. The challenge is that as of Go 1.20, the Seed function is deprecated.  Ref: https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/refs/tags/go1.21.0:src/math/rand/rand.go;l=394

![Codeium-generated seed function](./images/codeium-67.png?raw=true "Codeium-generated seed function") 

4. Let's see if Copilot understands that this is deprecrated. We'll ask it via a query in the main Chat interface. Switch to the Codeium Chat interface and enter the following prompt.

```
Is the Seed function deprecated in Go?
```
You will likely see a response in the Chat interface saying that it's not deprecated.

![Codeium-generated seed function](./images/codeium-69.png?raw=true "Codeium-generated seed function") 

5. So one way we can help Copilot understand language updates is by providing updated context in our file. So let's start again. Delete the current content in the explore.go file.

6. Now,let's provide Copilot some more direct context by copying in updated code examples. After deleting the code block from step 3, copy and paste in the following example of the replacement for the Seed deprecation into your explore.go file.  This is taken from pkg.go.dev/math/rand.

```
	// Create and seed the generator.
	// Typically a non-fixed seed should be used, such as time.Now().UnixNano().
	// Using a fixed seed will produce the same output on every run.
	// r := rand.New(rand.NewSource(99))
```

7. Now, let's try the creation of the function again. Underneath the comments and code you just pasted, invoke the dialog via **CMD+I** and enter the statement below again.
```
write a function to seed a random number generator
```

![Codeium-generated seed function attempt 2](./images/codeium-70.png?raw=true "Codeium-generated seed function attempt 2")

8. This time, the code should be using the same format and NewSource function as you put in the file in step 6. You can just Accept the change.

**Lab 7 - Kubernetes, YAML generation and the 2021 problem**

**Purpose: Show YAML generation and out of date content.**

1. Create a new file - **deployment.yaml**

```
code deployment.yaml
```

2. Bring up the Copilot Chat dialog via **CMD+I** and enter in (or copy and paste) the following request and hit the Submit button.

```
write spec for deployment in Kubernetes with 2 replicas and image from busybox
add command to run in containers: sleep 3600
add label app: myapp
add label type: front-end
```
![request Kubernetes manifest](./images/codeium-72.png?raw=true "request Kubernetes manifest")

3. After a few moments, you should see it respond with the code. You can just Accept this.
![Kubernetes manifest](./images/codeium-73.png?raw=true "Kubernetes manifest")

4. Suppose we don't know how to execute this code. Let's ask Codeium. Highlight the generated YAML in the deployment.yaml file.  Then go to the larger Chat interface and ask it. Put the following in the Chat interface. (See parts 1 and 2 in the next screenshot.)

```
How do I execute this - short version?
```

5. Codeium should respond with something similar to part 3 in the next screenshot. 
![How to execute deployment](./images/codeium-74.png?raw=true "How to execute deployment")


6. While we're in the Chat interface, let's ask it for the latest K8s version that it knows of. Put the following into the dialog.

```
what is the latest Kubernetes version that you know of?
```

7. Notice that it identifies the latest version as 1.23. This highlights the out-of-date issue with the LLM.

![Answer to latest K8s version](./images/codeium-75.png?raw=true "Answer to latest K8s version")

8. Notice also that Codeium helpfully generated a suggested command to determine what the current Kubernetes version is, along with options to *Copy* or *Insert in Terminal*. Go ahead and select the *Insert in Terminal* option and try to execute the command.

![Answer to latest K8s version](./images/codeium-76.png?raw=true "Answer to latest K8s version")

9. You'll notice that there's an unknown flag error for the *--short** option. This is because that option is deprecated but Codeium wasn't aware of that change. You can run the command without that option to see the current Kubernetes version.

![deprecated flag](./images/codeium-77.png?raw=true "deprecated flag")

8. Let's have Copilot generate some code to work with Kubernetes through the API. In the chat interface, enter the following.

```
How do I call the K8s API for scaling a deployment to 5 replicas with Python?
```

9. Create a new file and then paste the suggested code into the new file via the *Copy* or *Insert* option.

![Add code to new file](./images/codeium-78.png?raw=true "Add code to new file")


10. Suppose we change our mind and want to convert this code to Go. Click in the new file, and highlight the new code. Then, in the *Refactor* interface tell it to translate to Go.

```
translate to Go 
```
![Go translation](./images/codeium-79.png?raw=true "Go translation")


11. If you look at the generated differences, you should now have the equivalent Go code available for accepting.

**Lab 8 - Exploring Javascript, regular expression generator, auto-generating data**

**Purpose: Show Javascript and regular expression generation, auto-generate routine mappings**

1. Create a new file as **phone.js**

```
code phone.js
```

2. Prompt Copilot to create a function with a regular expression to validate a US phone number. You can use the **CMD+I** interface.
```
create a function to validate any global phone number using a regular expression
```
![prompt to validate phone #](./images/codeium-81.png?raw=true "prompt to validate phone #")

3. You can just *Accept* the suggested implementation.

![Regex function to validate phone #](./images/codeium-82.png?raw=true "regex function to validate phone #")   

3. Now let's see how Copilot can generate some data and mappings for us automatically. Enter the prompt below in the main Chat text entry area.
```
create a mapping of states to area codes in JavaScript where the key is the state abbreviation and the value is an array of area codes of max size 5
```
4. After running this, Copilot will generate the start of a list as shown below. Click on the *Insert* tab to insert the updates at the cursor in the *phone.js* file. (This assumes the cursor is below the previous function in the file.)

![Automatic gen of data](./images/codeium-84.png?raw=true "Automatic gen of data") 

5. Notice that the example mapping was only for about half of the states. We want to get the remaining mappings for the other states. Let's craft a prompt to complete the sequence. Enter the following in the main Copilot Chat entry box and then execute it. (You can substitute whatever state abbreviation it ended on for "after MI".)

```
create a mapping of the remaining states after MI to area codes in JavaScript where the key is the state abbreviation and the value is an array of area codes of max size 5
```


6 From the generated text in the chat, if the results look ok, you can copy the mappings and add them into the code file.
